Hey mister gimme back them dice
You're holding all the green but you're gonna lose a slice
Rock and roll bless my soul, my wallet's gettin' thinner
Sevens up, thank you Lord, now you're looking at a winner

Cos I'm a member of a gamblin' breed.
And when the actions hot, it gets me all I need
So if you find me in our town, won't you lay your money down?
It's satisfaction guaranteed
You get heaven, you'll get hell
There ain't no way for you to tell with a gamblin' man

Hey mama give me one more ace
I'm looking at a knave and he's laughing in my face
Raise the pot bet the lot we could all be dead tomorrow
I got an edge on the ledge not another man will follow

Cos I'm a member...

I said I'm a gambler, there's no question of that
But I never gamble on a woman, that's a matter of fact
Just ain't no predictin', which way their love will roll
One moment they're red hot - the next they're icy cold

Oh Lord, have mercy, give what wheel a spin
It's takin' candy from a baby in the mood I'm in
Rock and roll bless my soul, my wallet's lookin' healthy
Easy come, easy go, I never wanted to be wealthy
Just a paid up member of a gamblin' breed
And when the actions hot it gets me all I need
So if you find me in your town won't you lay your money down?
It's satisfaction guaranteed
You get heaven, you'll get hell there ain't no way for you to tell
With a gamblin' man

Lay your money down
