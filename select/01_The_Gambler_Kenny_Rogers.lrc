[00:05.76] On a warm summer's evening
[00:08.65] On a train bound for nowhere
[00:10.74] I met up with a gambler
[00:13.30] We were both too tired to sleep
[00:15.76] So we took turns a-staring
[00:18.31] Out the window at the darkness
[00:21.17] 'Til boredom overtook us
[00:23.83] And he began to speak
[00:34.33] 
[00:26.08] He said, "Son, I've made a life
[00:28.71] Out of readin' people's faces
[00:31.44] Knowing what the cards were
[00:34.32] By the way they held their eyes
[00:36.81] So if you don't mind my saying
[00:39.46] I can see you're out of aces
[00:42.16] For a taste of your whisky
[00:44.85] I'll give you some advice"
[00:57.85] 
[00:48.81] So I handed him my bottle
[00:51.77] And he drank down my last swallow
[00:54.62] Then he bummed a cigarette
[00:57.39] And asked me for a light
[00:59.93] And the night got deathly quiet
[01:02.32] And his face lost all expression
[01:05.17] Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
[01:08.09] You gotta learn to play it right"
[01:24.59] 
[01:10.50] You got to know when to hold 'em
[01:13.42] Know when to fold 'em
[01:16.02] Know when to walk away
[01:19.02] And know when to run
[01:21.30] You never count your money
[01:24.29] When you're sittin' at the table
[01:26.76] There'll be time enough for countin'
[01:29.86] When the dealing's done
[01:41.36] 
[01:37.44] "Every gambler knows
[01:39.41] That the secret to surviving
[01:42.57] Is knowing what to throw away
[01:45.31] Knowing what to keep
[01:47.52] 'Cause every hand's a winner
[01:50.24] And every hand's a loser
[01:53.04] And the best that you can hope for
[01:55.61] Is to die in your sleep"
[02:07.61] 
[01:58.65] And when he finished speaking
[02:01.28] He turned back toward the window
[02:03.43] Crushed out his cigarette
[02:07.26] And faded off to sleep
[02:09.65] And somewhere in the darkness
[02:12.49] The gambler he broke even
[02:15.32] And in his final words
[02:17.97] I found an ace that I could keep
[02:33.97] 
[02:20.57] You got to know when to hold 'em
[02:24.25] Know when to fold 'em
[02:26.86] Know when to walk away
[02:29.60] And know when to run
[02:31.77] You never count your money
[02:34.53] When you're sittin' at the table
[02:37.20] There'll be time enough for countin'
[02:39.97] When the dealing's done
[02:51.47] 
[02:43.05] You got to know when to hold 'em
[02:45.72] (When to hold 'em)
[02:47.50] Know when to fold 'em
[02:49.25] (When to fold 'em)
[02:51.51] Know when to walk away
[02:53.37] And know when to run
[02:54.81] You never count your money
[02:56.66] When you're sittin' at the table
[02:59.38] There'll be time enough for countin'
[03:02.09] When the dealing's done
[03:13.59] 
[03:04.57] You got to know when to hold 'em
[03:07.30] Know when to fold 'em
[03:10.33] Know when to walk away
[03:13.41] And know when to run
[03:15.41] You never count your money
[03:18.28] When you're sittin' at the table
[03:21.10] There'll be time enough for countin'
[03:23.75] When the dealing's done
