on a warm summer's evenin'
on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
we were both too tired to sleep
so we took turns a-starin'
out the window at the darkness
when boredom overtook us
he began to speak
he said son, I've made a life
out of readin' people's faces
knowin' what the cards were
by the way they held their eyes
so if you don't mind my sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice
so I handed him my bottle
and he drank down
my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette
and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet
and his faced lost
all expression
he said if you're gonna
play the game, boy
you gotta learn to play it right
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time
enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
every gambler knows
that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away
and knowin' what to keep
'cause every hand's a winner
and every hand's a loser
and the best that
you can hope for
is to die in your sleep
and when he finished speakin'
he turned back
toward the window
crushed out his cigarette
and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness
the gambler he broke even
and in his final words I found
an ace that I could keep
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time
enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time
enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time
enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
